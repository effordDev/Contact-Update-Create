Contact Update Create (Salesforce)

## Notes

A component that allows you to update/create a contact via a lookup 
field on any child object of contact, simply set the field api 
name in the page setup and the component will handle the rest.

Contains a public method to save/update the contact so it can easily be nested in parent components.
